# CP1404 Practicals

Hello! This repository contains all the practical work I've done for the CP1404 subject. 

## About Me

I'm a student passionate about coding and always eager to learn more. In this subject, I've learned a lot about writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

## Lessons Learned

Here are some of the main lessons I've learned about "clean code":

- **Readability**: Code should be self-explanatory. Good code should read like a book, making it easier for others (and future you) to understand.
- **Simplicity**: The best code is the code that is simplest to understand. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Comments**: Comments should explain the 'why' and not the 'what'. If the code is complex enough that it needs explaining, consider refactoring.
